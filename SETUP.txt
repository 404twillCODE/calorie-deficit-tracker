CALORIE DEFICIT TRACKER - SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
============================================

1. SUPABASE SETUP:
   - Go to https://supabase.com and create a free account
   - Create a new project (choose a name and database password)
   - Wait for the project to finish setting up (takes 1-2 minutes)
   - Go to Settings > API
   - Copy your Project URL and anon/public key
   - Create a .env file in the root directory with this content:
     
     SUPABASE_URL=your-project-url-here
     SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
     
     (Replace the placeholders with your actual credentials)
   - Run: npm run build-config (or: node build-config.js)
   - This will generate config.js from your .env file
   - Note: .env is in .gitignore and won't be committed to GitHub

2. DATABASE SETUP:
   - In your Supabase dashboard, go to SQL Editor
   - Open the supabase-setup.sql file from this project
   - Copy and paste the entire SQL script into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute the script
   - This will create the calorie_entries table with user authentication
   - The table includes Row Level Security (RLS) so users can only see their own data

3. AUTHENTICATION SETUP:
   - Supabase Authentication is already enabled by default
   - Users can sign up with email and password
   - Email verification is enabled by default - users must verify their email before signing in
   - After signup, users will see a message to check their email for verification
   - Each user's data is automatically isolated using Row Level Security
   - To customize email templates, see EMAIL-CUSTOMIZATION.md

4. GITHUB PAGES SETUP:
   - Push this repository to GitHub
   - Go to your repository Settings > Pages
   - Select your main branch as the source
   - Your app will be available at: https://[your-username].github.io/calorie-deficit-tracker/
   - Make sure to run "npm run build-config" before pushing to generate config.js

5. IPHONE WEB APP:
   - Open the website on your iPhone Safari browser
   - Tap the Share button
   - Select "Add to Home Screen"
   - The app will now appear as an icon on your home screen
   - Sign up or sign in to start tracking your calories

6. OPTIONAL - APP ICONS:
   - Create 192x192 and 512x512 PNG images
   - Name them icon-192.png and icon-512.png
   - Place them in the root directory
   - This will give your web app custom icons when added to home screen

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Users must create an account to use the app
- Each user's data is stored separately and securely
- The app requires Supabase to be configured - it will not work without it
- Make sure to keep your .env file secure and never commit it to GitHub
